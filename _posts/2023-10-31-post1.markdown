# My First Post

This is my first post on GitHub Pages. I'm using Jekyll to generate my site.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a great way to host your personal or project website for free. You can use your own domain name, choose from various themes, and customize your site with Jekyll.

## How to get started?

To get started with GitHub Pages, you need to create a repository for your site and configure a publishing source. You can use Markdown or HTML files to create your site content. You can also use Jekyll to add more features and functionality to your site.

For more information, see [Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and [Adding content to your GitHub Pages site using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).
