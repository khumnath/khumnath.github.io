# Key Features of Lekhika

As the developer of Lekhika, I am currently working on enhancing its accuracy and functionality. Despite being under development, Lekhika already boasts several features that make it a valuable tool for Nepali speakers:

- **Comprehensive Dictionary**: I have equipped Lekhika with a vast dictionary of Nepali words and phrases, ensuring accurate and consistent input.

- **Integration with Fcitx5**: Lekhika is not a standalone application; it is a table addon for Fcitx5. This means it's an extension that adds Nepali input capabilities to the Fcitx5 framework, allowing users to easily switch between Lekhika and other input methods.

## Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prchapagain/fcitx5-table-lekhika.git

# Navigate to the cloned directory
cd fcitx5-table-lekhika

# Create a new directory for the build
mkdir build

# Navigate to the build directory
cd build

# Run CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

# Build the project
make

# Install the project (you may need to use sudo)
sudo make install

# Install without build yourself
download installer zip from relesse and run install.sh

## Future Improvements

In addition to the features mentioned above, I am working on the following improvements for Lekhika:

- **Improved Suggestion Algorithm**: I am refining Lekhika's suggestion algorithm to provide more relevant word options, making it even easier for users to find the words they are looking for.

- **Enhanced Autocorrect Feature**: I am improving the autocorrect feature to minimize unwanted word replacements, ensuring that users have more control over their input.

## planning
- [X] Basic Nepali typing
- [ ] Improved suggestion words
- [ ] Remove unneeded words
- [ ] Add more dictionary
- [ ] And more to do as I experiment ðŸ˜„

## Problems
Some autocorrect words were disturbing typing. so i removed autocorrect words from table.i will add them gradualy. I am still improving this feature.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome. Dictionary and other improvements can be made as user find difficulties when typing.

You can find the repository on GitHub.
